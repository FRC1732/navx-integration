# navx-integration
A repository for code integrating the navx into robot eith java. This repository is intended for learning how to access and use data provided by navx, not for final competition code
This Repository is intended to provide a place to begin programming a practice bot with the navx

Current workers: Matthew Pomes, Christian Visiaya

The goal is to create a bot that can track it's own movements, if we have time.

Changes:
 + monitoring package: a package for the navx sensor class we're writing

Things to add:
 + virtual joysticks, to create accurate path follower
    + Turn to heading
